## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

#### Validation and React

React doesn't offer built-in form validation.

To get data from the form, all the components must be controlled, so that upper component can access the data and
submit it.

I relied on the HTML validation given that there was no need for complex validation/error messages. But I really
need to explore validation libraries for larger projects.

### Continued development

- Explore Formik and React Hook Form for form handling and validation in React applications. Vanilla experience was not
  that great.

### Useful resources

- [Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) -
  Explains the built-in HTML validation plus the JavaScript Constraint Validation API.
