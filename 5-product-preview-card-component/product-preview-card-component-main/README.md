## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

#### Changing an image content with the `content` property

```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    .product-card > img {
        content: url("images/image-product-desktop.jpg");
    }
}
```

### Continued development

See if SASS simplifies things as suggested in the challenge brief.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - Very practical to get the required fonts.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - Always useful.
