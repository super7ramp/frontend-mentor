## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

#### Flashcard Management

- Create new flashcards with a question, answer, and category
- Edit existing flashcards to update their details
- Delete flashcards they no longer need
- See form validation messages when trying to submit a card without all fields completed
- View all their flashcards in a grid layout
- See flashcard details including question, answer, category, and mastery progress

#### Study Mode

- Study flashcards one at a time in Study Mode
- Click on a flashcard to reveal the answer
- Mark a flashcard as known by clicking "I Know This" to track mastery progress
- Navigate between flashcards using Previous and Next buttons
- See which card they're currently viewing (e.g., "Card 1 of 40")
- Track mastery progress for each card on a scale of 0 to 5
- Reset progress on a flashcard to start learning it again

#### Filtering & Organization

- Filter flashcards by selecting one or multiple categories
- See the number of cards in each category within the filter dropdown
- Hide mastered cards to focus on cards that still need practice
- Shuffle flashcards to randomize the study order

#### Statistics & Progress

- View study statistics showing total cards, mastered, in progress, and not started counts

#### UI & Navigation

- Toggle between Study Mode and All Cards views
- Load more flashcards when viewing the full card list with more than 12 cards
- See a toast message when a card is created, updated, or deleted
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app using only their keyboard

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
