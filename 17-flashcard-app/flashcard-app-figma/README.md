# Using the Figma design file

Using this design file will help you practice building projects the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building projects.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is an extremely popular design tool with a generous free tier that works on Windows, Mac, and in the browser.

## Getting started

1. [Download the Figma Desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) for your operating system
2. Open the app and import the `.fig` file by dragging it into Figma or using the menu: **File → Import**
3. Start inspecting the design!

> **Note:** If using the Figma web app instead of the desktop app, download and install the Font Installer from the downloads page to ensure fonts display correctly.

## Useful tips for developers

### Inspecting elements

- **Select any element** to see its properties (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) in the right sidebar
- **Hold ⌥ (Mac) or Alt (Windows)** while hovering to see spacing between elements
- **Click on text** to see font family, size, weight, line height, and letter spacing

### Extracting values

- **Colors:** Click on any color in the right panel to copy its value (HEX, RGB, or HSL)
- **Fonts:** Select text to see all typography details in the right sidebar under "Text"
- **Dimensions:** Select any element to see its width, height, and position values

### A note on Dev Mode

Figma has a "Dev Mode" that provides a developer-focused view for inspecting designs. However, **Dev Mode is a paid feature**.

The good news is you don't need it! All the information required to build the project—colors, fonts, sizing, spacing—is available in Figma's free Design Mode using the tips above.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️**: Please don't share our design files with anyone else. We include `.gitignore` files in the starter code download to help prevent you accidentally uploading it to GitHub. Another easy way to stay safe is to keep the design file separate from your codebase.
